Analysis:
- What felt good: deterministic event log and reproducible combat flow.
- What felt bad / slow: simple bots can overcommit and miss better sequencing.
- Combat findings: Wounded and Pierce materially change blocked Shrine races.
- Shrine pressure findings: Iron pushes damage faster while Red stabilizes with restoration.
- Memory findings: Spirit dispersal and shrine triggers strongly influence evolution windows.
- Evolution findings: L2/L3 timings are highly deed-dependent.
- Phase / initiative findings: the reversal rule changes who gets the momentum swing.
- Card balance notes: generated from current deterministic bots only.
- Rule changes to test next: tweak shrine damage pacing, Memory generation, and Prepared timing.
